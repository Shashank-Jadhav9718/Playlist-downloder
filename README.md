# Playlist-downloder
This project is a YouTube Downloader using Streamlit and Pytube to download public/unlisted videos or entire playlists with quality selection. It detects single video vs. playlist URLs. Downloads are saved locally. Users must upgrade pytube often to bypass YouTube's anti-bot updates.
